AI Face Recognition App
The AI Face Recognition App is a modern face recognition system built using Streamlit and OpenCV. It enables users to recognize faces in uploaded images, manage a local facial database, and perform real-time recognition through a webcam.

This application is suitable for experimentation, learning, and small-scale local use cases that prioritize privacy and offline functionality.

Key Features
Face Recognition: Detect and identify known individuals from images.

Add New Faces: Train the system with multiple reference images for each person.

Face Database Management: View, update, and delete face profiles in the local database.

Real-Time Camera Mode (optional): Perform live recognition using a webcam stream.

High Accuracy: Leverages modern face detection and embedding models.

Privacy Focused: All data is stored and processed locally—no cloud or external APIs.

Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Streamlit – for the web-based UI

OpenCV – for face detection and video stream handling

face_recognition – for encoding and matching faces

NumPy, PIL – for image processing

Pickle / JSON – for storing face encodings and metadata locally

Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
 Usage
Launch the app and navigate through the sidebar options:

Upload & Recognize: Upload an image to identify faces.

Add a New Person: Provide multiple images to improve recognition accuracy.

View Database: Browse or manage stored individuals.

Real-Time Mode (if enabled): Activate your webcam for live recognition.

Tip: Ensure images are clear and well-lit for best performance.

 Notes
Face encodings are saved locally and can be retrained at any time.

Webcam functionality may require additional permissions depending on your OS.

All processing happens on the user's device, making this app ideal for offline environments.

 Future Enhancements
Add facial landmark detection and emotion recognition

Integrate face clustering and duplicate detection

Deploy as a standalone executable using PyInstaller or Docker

Role-based access for managing the face database
